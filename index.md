# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Manual

This manual intends to cover the various topics necessary for gaining an in-depth understand of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The method is widely used in different fields, such as medical engineering, coastal engineering, wave slam and much more. The aim of this guide is to gain an insight into the equations, numerical considerations and results based on this method. This manual covers the computational fluid dynamics part of SPH.
